fake = "Posted on November 4, 2016 by Charles Hugh Smith \nThe overwhelming consensus of the punditry across the political spectrum is that ?Nothing Good Can Come of This Election??and that?s a very good thing. The handwringing goes like this: The country is deeply divided by schisms that cannot be bridged, every institution from the two parties to the mainstream media to the Department of Justice has been tarnished by cover-ups, collusion or worse; whomever wins the election will enter the presidency without a mandate, and so on. \nWhy is ?nothing good can come of this? good? Because ridding the nation of its political corruption will require hitting bottom. \nJust as an alcoholic or drug addict is incapable of making any truly positive changes until he/she hits absolute bottom, so it is with our tolerance of a corrupt political system that is poisoning the nation, one injection of corrupt cash, collusion and pay-to-play at a time. \nIf our rotten-to-the-core politics as usual is indeed flying off the cliff to complete destruction, that is an unalloyed good. \nJust as alcoholics continue down their self-destructive path with the aid of enablers, so too has the corrupt political order expanded with the aid of the Mainstream Media, insiders in the Department of Justice, K Street lobbyists and a veritable army of well-paid lackeys, pundits, academics, apparatchiks and assorted toadies in the organs of governance and in the big-money private sector and philanthro-capitalist dynasties of pay-to-play foundations. \nThe only way anything will truly change in the political order is if every Establishment insider politico loses every election, from the presidency to dogcatcher. Nothing will change until the mere existence of a private foundation like the Clinton Foundation triggers a landslide loss for the politico with ties to such corruption. \nNothing will change until the collusion of the mainstream media (supplying the insider candidate with debate questions, etc.) alone causes the colluding candidate to lose by a landslide. \nNothing will change until candidates who refuse to accept any donation larger than $100 from anyone or any entity beat the Goldman Sachs/Saudi prince-funded insider candidates by a landslide. \nNothing will change until candidates who fund costly negative TV advertising campaigns with millions in pay-to-play ?contributions? from Goldman Sachs et al. lose by a landslide. \nYou get the point: we the citizens and voters have to stop being enablers of systemic corruption. We have to stop being bamboozled by insiders with promises of ?hope and change? and the usual negative TV blitzes funded by corrupt big money. \nIt?s easy to blame lax campaign laws or the corrupted candidates and their insider toadies, but ultimately we?re responsible for enabling corruption, collusion, pay-for-play and a political and financial Elite that?s above the law. \nFrom the point of view of the corrupted, colluding insiders, MSM flunkies, Department of Justice lackeys and well-paid parrot-pundits, nothing good can come from this election because half the voters may actually cast off the shackles of the nation?s corrupt and corrupting political and financial Elites. \nThis mass rejection of the politics as usual of corrupt and corrupting political and financial Elites is the highest possible good ?a public good that eludes the hand-wringing corrupt insiders, pundits and toadies who have sucked up fortunes from the trough of putrid systemic corruption.".replace('\n', '')

fake4 = "Written by Peter Van Buren   venerable New York Times ran a story saying Donald Trump lies about the height of his buildings.For no apparent reason, the Times resurrected some information from 1979 saying Trump insisted on counting the basement levels of his signature Trump Tower in the overall count of how many floors the building has. The Times compares this lie to ?reports? that Trump adds an inch to his actual body height in his bio materials, and also repeated the gag line that he boasted about how long his penis is (no word on whether it is or is not actually longer than expected.)You have to wade down to paragraph 12 to learn other New York developers use the same count-the-basements levels gimmick to be able to advertise their buildings as taller. There is absolutely no news. The Russians Head over to Slate , which published an ?investigative piece? alleging a Trump computer server was secretly communicating with a Russian bank. The story had previously been debunked by the New York Times and The Intercept, but Slate ran it as if they had uncovered the smoking gun proving Trump is under the control of the Russians.At Mother Jones , another article alleged that an anonymous, former intelligence officer provided the FBI with information on a Russian scheme to help Trump win the presidency.?There?s no way to tell whether the FBI has confirmed or debunked any of the allegations contained in the former spy?s memos,? the story said. ?But a Russian intelligence attempt to co-opt or cultivate a presidential candidate would mark an even more serious operation than the hacking.?One more example, from Vox , which wrote without even bothering to source it at all ?There is basically conclusive evidence that Russia is interfering in the US election, and that this interference has been designed to damage Hillary Clinton?s campaign. There is strong evidence linking Trump?s foreign policy advisers to Russia, and Trump?s stated policy ideas are extremely favorable to Russian interests.? Journalism Much? I?ve chosen these examples because they are from publications that have in the past enjoyed decent reputations for reporting, and because these stories were run as ?news,? not opinion columns, where the standards go right through the floor. Even Mother Jones, which clearly works left-of-center, used to do so with some solid journalism.Not any more.These places (never find fringe publications) are now working with the same standards once reserved for reporting on aliens at Roswell, Elvis sightings and the Illuminati New World Order. It is apparently now within the bounds of mainstream journalism to build a story out of, well, nothing, such as a factoid from 1979, or essentially accuse a presidential candidate of treason based on a single, anonymous source, or claim the Russians have taken over our electoral process based on no sources at all. And Clinton? On the other side, reporting on Clinton by many of these same publications swerves between hagiography and poo-pooing away anything unfavorable. Emails? Who cares! Questions about what her accomplishments as Secretary of State really were? If you ask, you hate women. Pay-for-Play with the Clinton Foundation? Hah, everybody does it, it doesn?t matter. The standard seems to be absent a notarized receipt for a donation matching an arms sale, or a criminal conviction, nothing matters. Next? So be it. The media has fully sh*t the bed this election. That?s where we find ourselves.But what?s next? Will the media reset itself after November 8, or will they run President Trump is Putin?s dog stories for the full term? Will President Clinton be given a pass on, well, everything, for four years, with apologists and explainers on the front page of the Times, never mind in editorials?At what point will the media dig themselves out of this and start real reporting again?

fake5 = "DOJ COMPLAINT: Comey Under Fire Over Partisan Witch Hunt For Hillary (TWEETS/VIDEO) By Natalie Dailey on October 30, 2016 Subscribe \nFor pretty much this entire election, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has gotten flak for the way she handled her emails during her tenure as Secretary of State. Congressional Republicans grilled her for hours about it, but have found nothing. These same Republicans just keep on complaining anyway. \nNow, the Director of the FBI, James Comey, wrote a memo saying some newly-found emails may be linked to Hillary Clinton and her private server. \nThe media and the supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump are excited about the possibility of the FBI reopening the investigation. \nSorry, guys, it?s not. \nA Republican Congressman started a Twitter shitstorm over this news: FBI Dir just informed me, \"The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\" Case reopened \n? Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 \nSpeaker of the House, Paul Ryan (R-Wis), said that Clinton?s security briefings should stop: BREAKING NEWS ? The FBI is reopening its investigation into Secretary Hillary Clinton. \nMy full statement ? pic.twitter.com/LHfyg46dWk \n? Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) October 28, 2016 \nAt least Hillary Clinton didn?t blab classified information on television. \nMany news outlets falsely reported that the entire investigation was back on. \nThe Associated Press tweeted: BREAKING: US official: Newly discovered emails related to Clinton investigation did not come from her private server. \n? AP Politics (@AP_Politics) October 28, 2016 \nThe emails were found during the investigation of disgraced ex-Congressman Anthony Weiner and his latest sexting scandal involving a 15-year-old girl. \nThe FBI doesn?t know for sure what is in the emails. It is very difficult to read emails when you don?t have a warrant to do so. This puts Comey?s letter to Congress in an even shadier light. All they know is that none of the emails are to or from Clinton herself, and they may only be duplicates of emails the FBI already has in their possession. \nThe Department of Justice has received a complaint from the Democratic Coalition Against Trump accusing FBI Director Comey of violating the Hatch Act . \nThe complaint reads in part: ?This is an election year, and we are just 11 days away from the date that the American public votes to choose the next President of the United States, I am writing to ask that an investigation be opened into Director Comey for any potential violations of the Hatch Act. The timing of this announcement, accompanied by the vague facts of the investigation, seems as if Director Comey was making a political move, and not a professional one.? \nPassed in 1939, the Hatch Act limits political activity of federal employees and certain state and D.C. employees who work with federal funding. It is meant to keep federal agencies from taking sides politically, and prevents employees from getting promotions based on political affiliations.".replace('\n', '')

fake8 = "The ?P? in PBS Should Stand for ?Plutocratic? or ?Pentagon? Posted on Oct 27, 2016 ( WikiMedia ) \nIn a television commercial that the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) ran for years, ?PBS NewsHour? host Gwen Ifill declared that she loved her job because it allowed her to ?ask not only all of my questions but also and more importantly all of your questions .? This assertion was and remains absurd, just like her network?s regular fundraising claim to be free of corporate sponsors. \nThe claim has long been contradicted by the string of corporate-image commercials (purchased by leading financial, defense, auto, insurance and rail corporations) that appear before the network?s nightly ?NewsHour? broadcast?along with a list of corporate-sponsored foundations and superwealthy individuals who pay for the show, along with ?regular viewers like you.? \nConsistent with those commercials and despite its name, the news and commentary one finds on PBS is in rich tune with the narrow capitalist parameters of acceptable coverage and debate that typify the more fully and explicitly for-profit and commercialized corporate media. As progressive journalist David Sirota suggested two years ago , reflecting on recent investigations showing that supermoneyed, right-wing capitalists such as the Koch brothers and Texas billionaire John Arnold had (along with more liberal software mogul Bill Gates) influenced PBS content through multimillion-dollar donations, the ?P? in PBS often seems to more properly stand for ?Plutocratic,? not ?Public.? \nAdvertisement Square, Site wide \nNone of this should be surprising to anyone familiar with the distinctively big-business-dominated history of U.S. broadcast media . Because the United States fails to provide anything like adequate funding for public broadcasting, both PBS and National Public Radio (a regular vehicle for neoliberal business ideology) depend upon foundations, corporations and wealthy individuals to pay for much of their programming. Beneath their standard claims to have no interest in shaping public media content, these private funders have bottom-line agendas, meaning that their contributions come with strings attached?strings that undermine the integrity of the ?independent? journalism they bankroll. (For what it?s worth, between 1994 and 2014, the ?NewsHour? was primarily owned by the for-profit firm Liberty Media . Liberty Media was run by the conservative and politically active billionaire John Malone, who had a majority stake in MacNeil/Lehrer Productions, the show?s producer.) \nThe Pentagon Broadcasting System? \nWhat might seem more surprising, perhaps, is the remarkable extent to which the ?P? in PBS often seems to stand for ?Pentagon,? or perhaps ?Presidential,? when it comes to foreign policy content. Whatever the global issue of the day or week, ?NewsHour? anchors and their invited ?experts? can be counted on to report and reflect in accord with the doctrinal assumption that Washington always operates with the best of intentions. They almost uniformly treat the U.S. as a great, benevolent and indispensable force for freedom, democracy, security, peace and order in a dangerous world full of evil and deadly actors. \nThe show?s invited commentators are drawn primarily from the nation?s imperial establishment. They are commonly current or retired insiders from within the Pentagon, the White House, the ?intelligence community? and/or the nation?s elite network of foreign policy think tanks: the Council on Foreign Relations (the granddaddy of all U.S. ruling-class think tanks ), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Aspen Institute, the Atlantic Council, the Rand Corp. and the Hoover Institution, to name a handful. ?NewsHour? anchors and guests generally agree that the United States? officially designated enemies are malevolent bad guys who need to be contained, controlled and even attacked by the ultimate good guy, Uncle Sam. \nNot surprisingly, the long and ongoing record of U.S. imperial arrogance and criminality (more on that below) is swept down George Orwell?s memory hole even as new entries are added to the ugly registry. When reported by the ?NewsHour,? horrific crimes committed by the U.S. military are always treated as well-intended mistakes. Along with the rest of the mainstream U.S. media, the ?NewsHour? ?insist[s] that Russia deliberately bombs hospitals, etc., whereas if we do it, it is, of course, an accident .? \nThere?s some room for disagreement between and among the show?s invited experts?including the show?s semi-loopy foreign policy authority, Margaret Warner?about specific U.S. foreign policy tactics, strategies and actions. There?s no space for serious debate about the immorality, lawlessness or imperial nature of that policy. On the rare occasions ?NewsHour? anchors seem to challenge guests from the White House or Pentagon on foreign policy matters, it is generally to ask why the U.S. isn?t going harder at the officially certified bad guys. \nAmerica as Umpire, Not Empire \nThe foreign policy coverage and commentary doesn?t get much better in the documentary division of PBS. A recent documentary (first aired nationally last week) shown by PBS bears the risible title ?American Umpire??an obvious World Series season play on what the filmmakers see as the preposterous notion of an American empire. It is narrated by ex-Marine and former ?NewsHour? host and producer Jim Lehrer. Developed by the right-wing Hoover Institution and ?targeted for PBS? (the organization?s own revealing phrase), ?American Umpire? takes the doctrinal ?American exceptionalist,? U.S.-good-and-civilized-rest-of-world-dangerous-and-bad narrative to absurd lengths. \nIt provides extensive ?expert? commentary from such former imperial operatives as Madeline Albright (the onetime U.S. secretary of state who led the charge to criminally bomb Serbia and who went on CBS? ?60 Minutes? to say that the death of more than half a million Iraqi children killed by Washington-led ?economic sanctions? was ?a price worth paying? for the advance of U.S. foreign policy goals), Condoleezza Rice (George W. Bush?s neoconservative national security adviser before and during the arch-criminal U.S. invasion of Iraq), Gen. Jim ?Mad Dog? Mattis (an Iraq invasion commander and a former chief of the U.S. Central Command, who two years ago told a San Diego audience that ?it?s fun to shoot people?), George Schultz (the Reagan-era secretary of state who called the Sandinista government in Nicaragua ?a cancer in our own land mass? that must be ?cut out?) and Karl Eikenberry (a retired Army lieutenant general who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan 10 years ago). \nWith further commentary from a handful of mostly conservative academicians?above all the nationalist Texas A&M historian Elizabeth Cobbs ( author of a book on which the documentary is based), ?American Umpire? portrays 20th and 21st century U.S. foreign policy as nothing more than a noble effort to selflessly provide welcome and fair rules and discipline on the rest of a childish, dangerous and reckless planet (think ?Lord of the Flies?) that lacks the exceptional historical experience bequeathed to U.S. leaders by the nation?s far-seeing Founding Fathers. The only substantive criticism of U.S. foreign policy in ?American Umpire? is the complaint, voiced by numerous interview subjects, that America harms itself to the benefit of others (the Europeans above all) by taking upon its shoulders too much of the burden of benevolently policing the planet. We are just too good for our own good. \nOur Real Task \nThere is not space here to discuss in responsible detail the epic historical deletions and distortions this narrative imposes. The omissions are staggering. They range from the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Filipinos resisting U.S. imperial invasion and occupation at the last century?s outset to the restoration of de facto slavery in Haiti and the Dominican Republic after World War I; the unnecessary atom bombing of Hiroshima and, even worse, of Nagasaki (really the first shots of the Cold War ); the toppling of more than 50 governments by U.S. coups and invasions since the end of World War II; the liquidation of perhaps as many as 5 million Southeast Asians in the so-called Vietnam War between 1962 and 1975; the Cold War-era sponsorship of Third World fascism from Chile to South Africa and Indonesia; the attempted assassinations of Fidel Castro and numerous CIA-directed terror bombings in socialist Cuba; the near instigation of global thermonuclear war on at least three occasions; the development and sponsorship of Osama bin Laden and other radically arch-reactionary, jihadist Muslim, paramilitary forces to fight the Cold War against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan; the ?Highway of Death,? when U.S. warplanes engaged in an aerial traffic jam as they rushed to slaughter tens of thousands of surrendered Iraqi troops retreating from Iraq in 1991; the coordination and sponsorship of a mass-murderous civil war on peasants, workers and intellectuals (with a death toll well into the many hundreds of thousands) in Central America during the 1970s and 1980s; the disastrous U.S. invasion of Iraq (responsible for at least 1 million Iraqi deaths); the calamitous U.S. toppling of the Libyan Gadhafi regime; the calamitous destabilization of the Syrian regime; the U.S. funding and encouragement of civil war in central Africa; the enablement and protection of a vicious right-wing coup in Honduras in the spring and summer of 2009; the criminal U.S. global war of terror, replete with rampant ?targeted assassinations,? torture, illegal renditions, endless drone war and special-forces killing operations across the Muslim world and other places as well. \n?American Umpire? hides these horrific transgressions and the imperial calculations behind much of U.S. foreign policy past and present. As numerous key U.S. planning documents reveal over and over, the goal of that policy was to maintain and, if necessary, install governments that ?favor[ed] private investment of domestic and foreign capital, production for export, and the right to bring profits out of the country.? Given the United States? remarkable possession of half the world?s capital after World War II, Washington elites had no doubt that U.S. investors and corporations would profit the most. Internally, the basic, selfish, national and imperial objectives were openly and candidly discussed. As the ?liberal? and ?dovish? imperialist, top State Department planner and key Cold War architect George F. Kennan explained in Policy Planning Study 23, a critical 1948 document: ?We have about 50% of the world?s wealth, but only 6.3% of its population. ? In this situation, we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment. Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity. ? To do so, we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and day-dreaming. ... The less we are then hampered by idealistic slogans, the better.? \nThe necessity of dispensing with ?human rights? and other ?sentimental? and ?unreal objectives? was especially pressing in the ?global south.? Washington assigned the vast periphery of the world economic (capitalist) system?Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and the energy-rich and thus strategically hypersignificant Middle East?a less than flattering role. It was to ?fulfill its major function as a source of raw materials and a market? ( actual State Department language ) for the great industrial (capitalist) nations (excluding ?socialist? Russia and its satellites). It was to be exploited both for the benefit of U.S. corporations/investors and for the reconstruction of Europe and Japan as prosperous U.S. trading and investment partners organized on properly capitalist principles that were hostile to the Soviet bloc. \n?Democracy? was fine as a slogan and benevolent, idealistic-sounding mission statement when it came to marketing this core, underlying, ultra-imperialist U.S. policy at home and abroad. Because most people in the ?Third World? had no interest in neocolonial subordination and subscribed to what U.S. intelligence officials considered the heretical ?idea that government has direct responsibility for the welfare of its people? (what post-World War II U.S. planners called ?communism?), Washington?s real-life commitment to popular governance abroad was strictly qualified, to say the least. ?Democracy? was suitable to the U.S. as long as its outcomes comported with the interests of U.S. investors/corporations and related U.S. geopolitical objectives. It had to be abandoned, undermined and/or crushed when it threatened those investors/corporations and the broader imperatives of business rule to any significant degree. As President Richard Nixon?s coldblooded National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger explained in June 1970, three years before the U.S. sponsored a fascist coup that overthrew Chile?s democratically elected leftist President Salvador Allende, ?I don?t see why we need to stand by and watch a country go Communist because of the irresponsibility of its own people.? \nThe selfish imperial cynicism of U.S. foreign policy continues to this day, into the post-Cold War and post-9/11 era. As leading Dutch political scientists Bastiaann van Apeldoorn and Nana de Graaff write in their important new volume , ?American Grand Strategy and Corporate Elite Networks: The Open Door Since the End of the Cold War,? ?From the end of the 19th nineteenth century onward, American grand strategy has pursued a liberal expansionism aimed at the creation of a global hegemony premised upon open, ?free? markets, to which global capital?and, above all, U.S. transnational capital?has full access. ? The global Open Door has continued to define the ends of the American grand strategy throughout the post-Cold War era.? Because?as during and before?the Cold War?s end, Washington?s commitment to ?democracy? and ?human rights? is conditional and hypocritical: The noble principles are fine insofar as they serve the free-market hegemony of global and especially U.S. transnational capital. They are dispensed with, even as U.S. policymakers trumpet them, when they do not.".replace('\n', '')
fake9 = " Anti-Trump Protesters Are Tools of the Oligarchy “Reform always provokes rage on the part of those who profit by the old order.” Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., The Crisis of the Old Order\nBy Paul Craig Roberts\n Who are the anti-Trump protesters besmirching the name of progressives by pretending to be progressives and by refusing to accept the outcome of the presidential election? They look like, and are acting worse than, the “white trash” that they are denouncing.\nI think I know who they are. They are thugs for hire and are paid by the Oligarchy to delegitimize Trump’s presidency in the way that Washington and the German Marshall Fund paid students in Kiev to protest the democratically elected Ukrainian government in order to prepare the way for a coup.\nThe organization, change.org, which claims to be a progressive group, but might be a front, along with other progressive groups, for the Oligarchy, is destroying the reputation of all progressives by circulating a petition that directs the electors of the Electoral Collage to annul the election by casting their votes for Hillary. Remember how upset progressives were when Trump said he might not accept the election result if there was evidence that the vote was rigged? Now progressives are doing what they damned Trump for saying he might do under certain conditions.\nThe Western presstitutes used the protests in Kiev to delegitimize a democratically elected government and to set it up for a coup. The protest pay was good enough that non-Ukrainians came from nearby countries to participate in the protest in order to collect the money. At the time I posted the amounts paid daily to protesters. Reports came in to me from Eastern and Western Europe from people who were not Ukrainian but were paid to protest as if they were Ukrainians.\nThe same thing is going on with the Trump protests. CNN reports that “for many Americans across the country, Donald Trump’s victory is an outcome they simply refuse to accept. Tens of thousands filled the streets in at least 25 US cities overnight.” This is the exact reporting that the Oligarchy desired from its presstitutes and got.\nI hope no one thinks that simultaneous protests in 25 cities were a spontaneous event. How did 25 independent protests manage to come up with the same slogans and the same signs on the same night following the election?\nWhat is the point of the protests, and what interest is served by them? As the Romans always asked, “who benefits?”\nThere is only one answer: The Oligarchy and only the Oligarchy benefits.\nTrump is a threat to the Oligarchy, because he intends to stop the giveaway of American jobs to foreigners. The jobs giveaway, sanctified by the neoliberal junk economists as “free trade,” is one of the main reasons for the 21st century worsening of the US income distribution. Money that was formerly paid in middle class wages and salaries to American manufacturing employees and college graduates has been re-routed to the pockets of the One Percent.\nWhen US corporations move their production of goods and services sold to Americans offshore to Asian countries, such as China and India, their wage bill falls. The money formerly paid in middle class incomes goes instead into executive bonuses and dividends and capital gains to shareholders. The ladders of upward mobility that had made America the land of opportunity were dismantled for the sole purpose of making a handful of people multi-billionaires.\nTrump is a threat to the Oligarchy, because he intends peaceful relations with Russia. In order to replace the profitable Soviet Threat, the Oligarchy and their neoconservative agents worked overtime to recreate the “Russian Threat” by demonizing Russia.\nAccustomed to many decades of excess profits from the profitable Cold War, the military/security complex was angry when President Reagan brought the Cold War to an end. Before these leaches on American taxpayers could get the Cold War going again, the Soviet Union collapsed as a result of a right-wing coup against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.\nThe military/security complex and their zionist neoconservative agents cooked up “the war on terror” to keep the money flowing to the One Percent. But as hard as the presstitute media worked to create fear of “the Muslim threat,” even insouciant Americans knew that the Muslims did not have thousands of ICBMs carrying powerful thermo-nuclear weapons capable of destroying the entirety of the United States in a few minutes. Neither did the Muslims have the Red Army capable of overrunning all of Europe in a couple of days. Indeed, the Muslims haven’t needed an army. Refugees from Washington’s wars enabled by Europeans are overrunning Europe.\nThe excuse for the annual trillion dollar ($1,000 billion ) military/security budget was missing. So the Oligarchy created “the New Hitler” in Russia. Hillary was the Oligarchy’s principle agent for heating up the new Cold War.\nHillary is the tool, enriched by the Oligarchy, whose job as President was to protect and to increase the trillion dollar budget of the military/security complex. With Hillary in the White House, the looting of the American taxpayers in behalf of the wealth of the One Percent could go forward unimpeded. But if Trump resolves “the Russian threat,” the Oligarchy takes an income hit.\nHillary’s job as President was also to privatize Social Security in order that her Wall Street benefactors can rip off Americans the way that Americans have been ripped off by the insurance companies under Obamacare.\nThose Americans who do not pay attention think, mistakenly, that the FBI cleared Hillary of violating National Security protocols with her email practices. The FBI said that Hillary did violate National Security, but that it was a result of carelessness or ignorance. She got off from indictment, because the FBI concluded that she did not intentionally violate National Security protocols. The investigation of the Clinton Foundation continues.\nIn other words, in order to protect Hillary the FBI fell back on the ancient common law rule that “there can be no crime without intent.” (See PCR and Lawrence Stratton, The Tyranny of Good Intentions .)\nOne would think that protesters, if they were legitimate, would be celebrating Trump’s victory. He, unlike Hillary, promises to reduce tensions with powerful Russia, and we hope also with China. Unlike Hillary, Trump says he is concerned with the absence of careers for those very people protesting in the streets of 25 cities against him.\nIn other words, the protests against the American people for electing Trump as their president are pointless. The protests are happening for one reason only. The Oligarchy intends to delegitimize the Trump Presidency. Once President Trump is delegitimized, it will be easier for the Oligarchy to assassinate him. Unless the Oligarchy can appoint and control Trump’s government, Trump is a prime candidate for assassination.\nThe protests against Trump are suspicious for another reason. Unlike Hillary, Obama, and George W. Bush, Donald Trump has not slaughtered and dislocated millions of peoples in seven countries, sending millions of refugees from the Oligarchy’s wars to overrun Europe.\nTrump earned his fortune, and if by hook or crook, not by selling US government influence to foreign agents as Bill and Hillary did.\nSo what are the protesters protesting?\nThere is no answer except that they are hired to protest. Just as the Maidan protesters in Kiev were hired to protest by US and German financed NGOs.\nThe protests in Kiev were equally pointless, because presidential elections were only months away. If Ukrainians really believed that their president was conspiring with Russia to keep Ukraine from becoming a Western puppet state and wished to become a puppet state regardless of the costs, the opportunity to vote the government out was at hand. The only reason for the protests was to orchestrate a coup. The US did succeed in putting their agent in control of the new Ukrainian government as Victoria Nuland and the US ambassador in Kiev confirmed in their telephone conversation that is available on the Internet.\nThe Maidan protests were pointless except for making a coup possible. The protests were without any doubt arranged by Washington through Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, a neoconservative brought into the State Department by Hillary Clinton for the purpose of creating conflict with Russia.\nTrump is being protested in order to make him vulnerable in the event he proves to be the threat to the Oligarchy that he is thought to be.\nTrump won the presidency, but the Oligarchy is still in power, which makes any real reforms difficult to achieve. Symbolic reforms can be the product of the contest between President Trump and the oligarchs.\nKarl Marx learned from historical experience, and Lenin, Stalin, and Pol Pot learned from Karl Marx, that change cannot occur if the displaced ruling class is left intact after a revolution against them. We have proof of this throughout South America. Every revolution by the indigenous people has left unmolested the Spanish ruling class, and every revolution has been overthrown by collusion between the ruling class and Washington.\nWashington has conspired with traditional elites to remove the elected presidents of Honduras on a number of occasions. Recently, Washington helped elites evict the female presidents of Argentina and Brazil. The presidents of Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia are in the crosshairs and are unlikely to survive. Washington is determined to get its hands on Julian Assange. To achieve this Washington intends to overthrow the Ecuadoran government that, in defiance of Washington, gave Julian Assange political asylum.\nHugo Chavez had the power to exile or to exterminate the Spanish ruling class in Venezuela when the ruling class participated in a CIA coup against Chavez. But before the CIA could kill Chavez, the people and the military forced his release. Instead of punishing the criminals who would have murdered him, Chavez let them go.\nAccording to Marx, Lenin, and Stalin, this is the classic mistake of the revolutionary. To rely on good will from the overthrown ruling class is the certain road to the defeat of the revolution.\nLatin American has proved itself unable to learn this lesson: Revolutions cannot be conciliatory.\nTrump is a dealmaker. The Oligarchy can permit him the sheen of success in exchange for no real change.\nTrump is not perfect. He might fail on his own. But we should back him on the two most important elements in his program: to reduce tensions between the major nuclear powers, and to halt Washington’s policy of permitting globalism to destroy Americans’ economic prospects.\nIf tensions between nuclear powers worsen, we won’t be here to worry about other problems. The combination of the economy hollowed out by globalism and immigration is an economic nightmare. That Trump understands this is reason to support him.\nNote: Some believe that Trump is a ruse conducted by the Oligarchy. However, as Hillary is the bought-and-paid-for representative of the Oligarchy, such an elaborate ruse is unnecessary. It is preferable for the Oligarchy to win on its own platform than to install a president on the opposite platform and then change him around. Another sellout increases the anger of the people. If Hillary had won, the Oligarchy would have had the voters’ mandate for their platform.\nDr. Paul Craig Roberts was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy and associate editor of the Wall Street Journal. He was columnist for Business Week, Scripps Howard News Service, and Creators Syndicate. He has had many university appointments. His internet columns have attracted a worldwide following.
