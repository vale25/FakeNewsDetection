fake = "Posted on November 4, 2016 by Charles Hugh Smith \nThe overwhelming consensus of the punditry across the political spectrum is that ?Nothing Good Can Come of This Election??and that?s a very good thing. The handwringing goes like this: The country is deeply divided by schisms that cannot be bridged, every institution from the two parties to the mainstream media to the Department of Justice has been tarnished by cover-ups, collusion or worse; whomever wins the election will enter the presidency without a mandate, and so on. \nWhy is ?nothing good can come of this? good? Because ridding the nation of its political corruption will require hitting bottom. \nJust as an alcoholic or drug addict is incapable of making any truly positive changes until he/she hits absolute bottom, so it is with our tolerance of a corrupt political system that is poisoning the nation, one injection of corrupt cash, collusion and pay-to-play at a time. \nIf our rotten-to-the-core politics as usual is indeed flying off the cliff to complete destruction, that is an unalloyed good. \nJust as alcoholics continue down their self-destructive path with the aid of enablers, so too has the corrupt political order expanded with the aid of the Mainstream Media, insiders in the Department of Justice, K Street lobbyists and a veritable army of well-paid lackeys, pundits, academics, apparatchiks and assorted toadies in the organs of governance and in the big-money private sector and philanthro-capitalist dynasties of pay-to-play foundations. \nThe only way anything will truly change in the political order is if every Establishment insider politico loses every election, from the presidency to dogcatcher. Nothing will change until the mere existence of a private foundation like the Clinton Foundation triggers a landslide loss for the politico with ties to such corruption. \nNothing will change until the collusion of the mainstream media (supplying the insider candidate with debate questions, etc.) alone causes the colluding candidate to lose by a landslide. \nNothing will change until candidates who refuse to accept any donation larger than $100 from anyone or any entity beat the Goldman Sachs/Saudi prince-funded insider candidates by a landslide. \nNothing will change until candidates who fund costly negative TV advertising campaigns with millions in pay-to-play ?contributions? from Goldman Sachs et al. lose by a landslide. \nYou get the point: we the citizens and voters have to stop being enablers of systemic corruption. We have to stop being bamboozled by insiders with promises of ?hope and change? and the usual negative TV blitzes funded by corrupt big money. \nIt?s easy to blame lax campaign laws or the corrupted candidates and their insider toadies, but ultimately we?re responsible for enabling corruption, collusion, pay-for-play and a political and financial Elite that?s above the law. \nFrom the point of view of the corrupted, colluding insiders, MSM flunkies, Department of Justice lackeys and well-paid parrot-pundits, nothing good can come from this election because half the voters may actually cast off the shackles of the nation?s corrupt and corrupting political and financial Elites. \nThis mass rejection of the politics as usual of corrupt and corrupting political and financial Elites is the highest possible good ?a public good that eludes the hand-wringing corrupt insiders, pundits and toadies who have sucked up fortunes from the trough of putrid systemic corruption.".replace('\n', '')

fake4 = "Written by Peter Van Buren   venerable New York Times ran a story saying Donald Trump lies about the height of his buildings.For no apparent reason, the Times resurrected some information from 1979 saying Trump insisted on counting the basement levels of his signature Trump Tower in the overall count of how many floors the building has. The Times compares this lie to ?reports? that Trump adds an inch to his actual body height in his bio materials, and also repeated the gag line that he boasted about how long his penis is (no word on whether it is or is not actually longer than expected.)You have to wade down to paragraph 12 to learn other New York developers use the same count-the-basements levels gimmick to be able to advertise their buildings as taller. There is absolutely no news. The Russians Head over to Slate , which published an ?investigative piece? alleging a Trump computer server was secretly communicating with a Russian bank. The story had previously been debunked by the New York Times and The Intercept, but Slate ran it as if they had uncovered the smoking gun proving Trump is under the control of the Russians.At Mother Jones , another article alleged that an anonymous, former intelligence officer provided the FBI with information on a Russian scheme to help Trump win the presidency.?There?s no way to tell whether the FBI has confirmed or debunked any of the allegations contained in the former spy?s memos,? the story said. ?But a Russian intelligence attempt to co-opt or cultivate a presidential candidate would mark an even more serious operation than the hacking.?One more example, from Vox , which wrote without even bothering to source it at all ?There is basically conclusive evidence that Russia is interfering in the US election, and that this interference has been designed to damage Hillary Clinton?s campaign. There is strong evidence linking Trump?s foreign policy advisers to Russia, and Trump?s stated policy ideas are extremely favorable to Russian interests.? Journalism Much? I?ve chosen these examples because they are from publications that have in the past enjoyed decent reputations for reporting, and because these stories were run as ?news,? not opinion columns, where the standards go right through the floor. Even Mother Jones, which clearly works left-of-center, used to do so with some solid journalism.Not any more.These places (never find fringe publications) are now working with the same standards once reserved for reporting on aliens at Roswell, Elvis sightings and the Illuminati New World Order. It is apparently now within the bounds of mainstream journalism to build a story out of, well, nothing, such as a factoid from 1979, or essentially accuse a presidential candidate of treason based on a single, anonymous source, or claim the Russians have taken over our electoral process based on no sources at all. And Clinton? On the other side, reporting on Clinton by many of these same publications swerves between hagiography and poo-pooing away anything unfavorable. Emails? Who cares! Questions about what her accomplishments as Secretary of State really were? If you ask, you hate women. Pay-for-Play with the Clinton Foundation? Hah, everybody does it, it doesn?t matter. The standard seems to be absent a notarized receipt for a donation matching an arms sale, or a criminal conviction, nothing matters. Next? So be it. The media has fully sh*t the bed this election.

Congressional Republicans grilled her for hours about it, but have found nothing. These same Republicans just keep on complaining anyway. \nNow, the Director of the FBI, James Comey, wrote a memo saying some newly-found emails may be linked to Hillary Clinton and her private server. \nThe media and the supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump are excited about the possibility of the FBI reopening the investigation. \nSorry, guys, it?s not. \nA Republican Congressman started a Twitter shitstorm over this news: FBI Dir just informed me, \"The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\" Case reopened \n?

It is very difficult to read emails when you don?t have a warrant to do so. This puts Comey?s letter to Congress in an even shadier light.

fake8 = "The ?P? in PBS Should Stand for ?Plutocratic? or ?Pentagon? Posted on Oct 27, 2016 ( WikiMedia ) \nIn a television commercial that the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) ran for years, ?PBS NewsHour? host Gwen Ifill declared that she loved her job because it allowed her to ?ask not only all of my questions but also and more importantly all of your questions .? This assertion was and remains absurd, just like her network?s regular fundraising claim to be free of corporate sponsors. \nThe claim has long been contradicted by the string of corporate-image commercials (purchased by leading financial, defense, auto, insurance and rail corporations) that appear before the network?s nightly ?NewsHour? broadcast?along with a list of corporate-sponsored foundations and superwealthy individuals who pay for the show, along with ?regular viewers like you.? \nConsistent with those commercials and despite its name, the news and commentary one finds on PBS is in rich tune with the narrow capitalist parameters of acceptable coverage and debate that typify the more fully and explicitly for-profit and commercialized corporate media. As progressive journalist David Sirota suggested two years ago , reflecting on recent investigations showing that supermoneyed, right-wing capitalists such as the Koch brothers and Texas billionaire John Arnold had (along with more liberal software mogul Bill Gates) influenced PBS content through multimillion-dollar donations, the ?P? in PBS often seems to more properly stand for ?Plutocratic,? not ?Public.? \nAdvertisement Square, Site wide \nNone of this should be surprising to anyone familiar with the distinctively big-business-dominated history of U.S. broadcast media . Because the United States fails to provide anything like adequate funding for public broadcasting, both PBS and National Public Radio (a regular vehicle for neoliberal business ideology) depend upon foundations, corporations and wealthy individuals to pay for much of their programming. Beneath their standard claims to have no interest in shaping public media content, these private funders have bottom-line agendas, meaning that their contributions come with strings attached?strings that undermine the integrity of the ?independent? journalism they bankroll. (For what it?s worth, between 1994 and 2014, the ?NewsHour? was primarily owned by the for-profit firm Liberty Media . Liberty Media was run by the conservative and politically active billionaire John Malone, who had a majority stake in MacNeil/Lehrer Productions, the show?s producer.) \nThe Pentagon Broadcasting System? \nWhat might seem more surprising, perhaps, is the remarkable extent to which the ?P? in PBS often seems to stand for ?Pentagon,? or perhaps ?Presidential,? when it comes to foreign policy content. Whatever the global issue of the day or week, ?NewsHour? anchors and their invited ?experts? can be counted on to report and reflect in accord with the doctrinal assumption that Washington always operates with the best of intentions. They almost uniformly treat the U.S. as a great, benevolent and indispensable force for freedom, democracy, security, peace and order in a dangerous world full of evil and deadly actors. \nThe show?s invited commentators are drawn primarily from the nation?s imperial establishment. They are commonly current or retired insiders from within the Pentagon, the White House, the ?intelligence community? and/or the nation?s elite network of foreign policy think tanks: the Council on Foreign Relations (the granddaddy of all U.S. ruling-class think tanks ), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Aspen Institute, the Atlantic Council, the Rand Corp. and the Hoover Institution, to name a handful. ?NewsHour? anchors and guests generally agree that the United States? officially designated enemies are malevolent bad guys who need to be contained, controlled and even attacked by the ultimate good guy, Uncle Sam. \nNot surprisingly, the long and ongoing record of U.S. imperial arrogance and criminality (more on that below) is swept down George Orwell?s memory hole even as new entries are added to the ugly registry. When reported by the ?NewsHour,? horrific crimes committed by the U.S. military are always treated as well-intended mistakes. Along with the rest of the mainstream U.S. media, the ?NewsHour? ?insist[s] that Russia deliberately bombs hospitals, etc., whereas if we do it, it is, of course, an accident .? \nThere?s some room for disagreement between and among the show?s invited experts?including the show?s semi-loopy foreign policy authority, Margaret Warner?about specific U.S. foreign policy tactics, strategies and actions. There?s no space for serious debate about the immorality, lawlessness or imperial nature of that policy. On the rare occasions ?NewsHour? anchors seem to challenge guests from the White House or Pentagon on foreign policy matters, it is generally to ask why the U.S. isn?t going harder at the officially certified bad guys. \nAmerica as Umpire, Not Empire \nThe foreign policy coverage and commentary doesn?t get much better in the documentary division of PBS. A recent documentary (first aired nationally last week) shown by PBS bears the risible title ?American Umpire??an obvious World Series season play on what the filmmakers see as the preposterous notion of an American empire. It is narrated by ex-Marine and former ?NewsHour? host and producer Jim Lehrer. Developed by the right-wing Hoover Institution and ?targeted for PBS? (the organization?s own revealing phrase), ?American Umpire? takes the doctrinal ?American exceptionalist,? U.S.-good-and-civilized-rest-of-world-dangerous-and-bad narrative to absurd lengths. \nIt provides extensive ?expert? commentary from such former imperial operatives as Madeline Albright (the onetime U.S. secretary of state who led the charge to criminally bomb Serbia and who went on CBS? ?60 Minutes? to say that the death of more than half a million Iraqi children killed by Washington-led ?economic sanctions? was ?a price worth paying? for the advance of U.S. foreign policy goals), Condoleezza Rice (George W. Bush?s neoconservative national security adviser before and during the arch-criminal U.S. invasion of Iraq), Gen. Jim ?Mad Dog? Mattis (an Iraq invasion commander and a former chief of the U.S. Central Command, who two years ago told a San Diego audience that ?it?s fun to shoot people?), George Schultz (the Reagan-era secretary of state who called the Sandinista government in Nicaragua ?a cancer in our own land mass? that must be ?cut out?) and Karl Eikenberry (a retired Army lieutenant general who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan 10 years ago). \nWith further commentary from a handful of mostly conservative academicians?above all the nationalist Texas A&M historian Elizabeth Cobbs ( author of a book on which the documentary is based), ?American Umpire? portrays 20th and 21st century U.S. foreign policy as nothing more than a noble effort to selflessly provide welcome and fair rules and discipline on the rest of a childish, dangerous and reckless planet (think ?Lord of the Flies?) that lacks the exceptional historical experience bequeathed to U.S. leaders by the nation?s far-seeing Founding Fathers. The only substantive criticism of U.S. foreign policy in ?American Umpire? is the complaint, voiced by numerous interview subjects, that America harms itself to the benefit of others (the Europeans above all) by taking upon its shoulders too much of the burden of benevolently policing the planet. We are just too good for our own good. \nOur Real Task \nThere is not space here to discuss in responsible detail the epic historical deletions and distortions this narrative imposes. The omissions are staggering. They range from the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Filipinos resisting U.S. imperial invasion and occupation at the last century?s outset to the restoration of de facto slavery in Haiti and the Dominican Republic after World War I; the unnecessary atom bombing of Hiroshima and, even worse, of Nagasaki (really the first shots of the Cold War ); the toppling of more than 50 governments by U.S. coups and invasions since the end of World War II; the liquidation of perhaps as many as 5 million Southeast Asians in the so-called Vietnam War between 1962 and 1975; the Cold War-era sponsorship of Third World fascism from Chile to South Africa and Indonesia; the attempted assassinations of Fidel Castro and numerous CIA-directed terror bombings in socialist Cuba; the near instigation of global thermonuclear war on at least three occasions; the development and sponsorship of Osama bin Laden and other radically arch-reactionary, jihadist Muslim, paramilitary forces to fight the Cold War against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan; the ?Highway of Death,? when U.S. warplanes engaged in an aerial traffic jam as they rushed to slaughter tens of thousands of surrendered Iraqi troops retreating from Iraq in 1991; the coordination and sponsorship of a mass-murderous civil war on peasants, workers and intellectuals (with a death toll well into the many hundreds of thousands) in Central America during the 1970s and 1980s; the disastrous U.S. invasion of Iraq (responsible for at least 1 million Iraqi deaths); the calamitous U.S. toppling of the Libyan Gadhafi regime; the calamitous destabilization of the Syrian regime; the U.S. funding and encouragement of civil war in central Africa; the enablement and protection of a vicious right-wing coup in Honduras in the spring and summer of 2009; the criminal U.S. global war of terror, replete with rampant ?targeted assassinations,? torture, illegal renditions, endless drone war and special-forces killing operations across the Muslim world and other places as well. \n?American Umpire? hides these horrific transgressions and the imperial calculations behind much of U.S. foreign policy past and present. As numerous key U.S. planning documents reveal over and over, the goal of that policy was to maintain and, if necessary, install governments that ?favor[ed] private investment of domestic and foreign capital, production for export, and the right to bring profits out of the country.? Given the United States? remarkable possession of half the world?s capital after World War II, Washington elites had no doubt that U.S. investors and corporations would profit the most. Internally, the basic, selfish, national and imperial objectives were openly and candidly discussed. As the ?liberal? and ?dovish? imperialist, top State Department planner and key Cold War architect George F. Kennan explained in Policy Planning Study 23, a critical 1948 document: ?We have about 50% of the world?s wealth, but only 6.3% of its population. ? In this situation, we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment. Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity. ? To do so, we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and day-dreaming. ... The less we are then hampered by idealistic slogans, the better.? \nThe necessity of dispensing with ?human rights? and other ?sentimental? and ?unreal objectives? was especially pressing in the ?global south.? Washington assigned the vast periphery of the world economic (capitalist) system?Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and the energy-rich and thus strategically hypersignificant Middle East?a less than flattering role. It was to ?fulfill its major function as a source of raw materials and a market? ( actual State Department language ) for the great industrial (capitalist) nations (excluding ?socialist? Russia and its satellites). It was to be exploited both for the benefit of U.S. corporations/investors and for the reconstruction of Europe and Japan as prosperous U.S. trading and investment partners organized on properly capitalist principles that were hostile to the Soviet bloc. \n?Democracy? was fine as a slogan and benevolent, idealistic-sounding mission statement when it came to marketing this core, underlying, ultra-imperialist U.S. policy at home and abroad. Because most people in the ?Third World? had no interest in neocolonial subordination and subscribed to what U.S. intelligence officials considered the heretical ?idea that government has direct responsibility for the welfare of its people? (what post-World War II U.S. planners called ?communism?), Washington?s real-life commitment to popular governance abroad was strictly qualified, to say the least. ?Democracy? was suitable to the U.S. as long as its outcomes comported with the interests of U.S. investors/corporations and related U.S. geopolitical objectives. It had to be abandoned, undermined and/or crushed when it threatened those investors/corporations and the broader imperatives of business rule to any significant degree. As President Richard Nixon?s coldblooded National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger explained in June 1970, three years before the U.S. sponsored a fascist coup that overthrew Chile?s democratically elected leftist President Salvador Allende, ?I don?t see why we need to stand by and watch a country go Communist because of the irresponsibility of its own people.? \nThe selfish imperial cynicism of U.S. foreign policy continues to this day, into the post-Cold War and post-9/11 era. As leading Dutch political scientists Bastiaann van Apeldoorn and Nana de Graaff write in their important new volume , ?American Grand Strategy and Corporate Elite Networks: The Open Door Since the End of the Cold War,? ?From the end of the 19th nineteenth century onward, American grand strategy has pursued a liberal expansionism aimed at the creation of a global hegemony premised upon open, ?free? markets, to which global capital?and, above all, U.S. transnational capital?has full access. ? The global Open Door has continued to define the ends of the American grand strategy throughout the post-Cold War era.? Because?as during and before?the Cold War?s end, Washington?s commitment to ?democracy? and ?human rights? is conditional and hypocritical: The noble principles are fine insofar as they serve the free-market hegemony of global and especially U.S. transnational capital. They are dispensed with, even as U.S. policymakers trumpet them, when they do not.".replace('\n', '')
fake9 = " Anti-Trump Protesters Are Tools of the Oligarchy “Reform always provokes rage on the part of those who profit by the old order.” Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., The Crisis of the Old Order\nBy Paul Craig Roberts\n Who are the anti-Trump protesters besmirching the name of progressives by pretending to be progressives and by refusing to accept the outcome of the presidential election? They look like, and are acting worse than, the “white trash” that they are denouncing.\nI think I know who they are. They are thugs for hire and are paid by the Oligarchy to delegitimize Trump’s presidency in the way that Washington and the German Marshall Fund paid students in Kiev to protest the democratically elected Ukrainian government in order to prepare the way for a coup.\nThe organization, change.org, which claims to be a progressive group, but might be a front, along with other progressive groups, for the Oligarchy, is destroying the reputation of all progressives by circulating a petition that directs the electors of the Electoral Collage to annul the election by casting their votes for Hillary. Remember how upset progressives were when Trump said he might not accept the election result if there was evidence that the vote was rigged? Now progressives are doing what they damned Trump for saying he might do under certain conditions.\nThe Western presstitutes used the protests in Kiev to delegitimize a democratically elected government and to set it up for a coup. The protest pay was good enough that non-Ukrainians came from nearby countries to participate in the protest in order to collect the money. At the time I posted the amounts paid daily to protesters. Reports came in to me from Eastern and Western Europe from people who were not Ukrainian but were paid to protest as if they were Ukrainians.\nThe same thing is going on with the Trump protests. CNN reports that “for many Americans across the country, Donald Trump’s victory is an outcome they simply refuse to accept. Tens of thousands filled the streets in at least 25 US cities overnight.” This is the exact reporting that the Oligarchy desired from its presstitutes and got.\nI hope no one thinks that simultaneous protests in 25 cities were a spontaneous event. How did 25 independent protests manage to come up with the same slogans and the same signs on the same night following the election?\nWhat is the point of the protests, and what interest is served by them? As the Romans always asked, “who benefits?”\nThere is only one answer: The Oligarchy and only the Oligarchy benefits.\nTrump is a threat to the Oligarchy, because he intends to stop the giveaway of American jobs to foreigners. The jobs giveaway, sanctified by the neoliberal junk economists as “free trade,” is one of the main reasons for the 21st century worsening of the US income distribution. Money that was formerly paid in middle class wages and salaries to American manufacturing employees and college graduates has been re-routed to the pockets of the One Percent.\nWhen US corporations move their production of goods and services sold to Americans offshore to Asian countries, such as China and India, their wage bill falls. The money formerly paid in middle class incomes goes instead into executive bonuses and dividends and capital gains to shareholders. The ladders of upward mobility that had made America the land of opportunity were dismantled for the sole purpose of making a handful of people multi-billionaires.\nTrump is a threat to the Oligarchy, because he intends peaceful relations with Russia. In order to replace the profitable Soviet Threat, the Oligarchy and their neoconservative agents worked overtime to recreate the “Russian Threat” by demonizing Russia.\nAccustomed to many decades of excess profits from the profitable Cold War, the military/security complex was angry when President Reagan brought the Cold War to an end. Before these leaches on American taxpayers could get the Cold War going again, the Soviet Union collapsed as a result of a right-wing coup against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.\nThe military/security complex and their zionist neoconservative agents cooked up “the war on terror” to keep the money flowing to the One Percent. But as hard as the presstitute media worked to create fear of “the Muslim threat,” even insouciant Americans knew that the Muslims did not have thousands of ICBMs carrying powerful thermo-nuclear weapons capable of destroying the entirety of the United States in a few minutes. Neither did the Muslims have the Red Army capable of overrunning all of Europe in a couple of days. Indeed, the Muslims haven’t needed an army. Refugees from Washington’s wars enabled by Europeans are overrunning Europe.\nThe excuse for the annual trillion dollar ($1,000 billion ) military/security budget was missing. So the Oligarchy created “the New Hitler” in Russia. Hillary was the Oligarchy’s principle agent for heating up the new Cold War.\nHillary is the tool, enriched by the Oligarchy, whose job as President was to protect and to increase the trillion dollar budget of the military/security complex. With Hillary in the White House, the looting of the American taxpayers in behalf of the wealth of the One Percent could go forward unimpeded. But if Trump resolves “the Russian threat,” the Oligarchy takes an income hit.\nHillary’s job as President was also to privatize Social Security in order that her Wall Street benefactors can rip off Americans the way that Americans have been ripped off by the insurance companies under Obamacare.\nThose Americans who do not pay attention think, mistakenly, that the FBI cleared Hillary of violating National Security protocols with her email practices. The FBI said that Hillary did violate National Security, but that it was a result of carelessness or ignorance. She got off from indictment, because the FBI concluded that she did not intentionally violate National Security protocols. The investigation of the Clinton Foundation continues.\nIn other words, in order to protect Hillary the FBI fell back on the ancient common law rule that “there can be no crime without intent.” (See PCR and Lawrence Stratton, The Tyranny of Good Intentions .)\nOne would think that protesters, if they were legitimate, would be celebrating Trump’s victory. He, unlike Hillary, promises to reduce tensions with powerful Russia, and we hope also with China. Unlike Hillary, Trump says he is concerned with the absence of careers for those very people protesting in the streets of 25 cities against him.\nIn other words, the protests against the American people for electing Trump as their president are pointless. The protests are happening for one reason only. The Oligarchy intends to delegitimize the Trump Presidency. Once President Trump is delegitimized, it will be easier for the Oligarchy to assassinate him. Unless the Oligarchy can appoint and control Trump’s government, Trump is a prime candidate for assassination.\nThe protests against Trump are suspicious for another reason. Unlike Hillary, Obama, and George W. Bush, Donald Trump has not slaughtered and dislocated millions of peoples in seven countries, sending millions of refugees from the Oligarchy’s wars to overrun Europe.\nTrump earned his fortune, and if by hook or crook, not by selling US government influence to foreign agents as Bill and Hillary did.\nSo what are the protesters protesting?\nThere is no answer except that they are hired to protest. Just as the Maidan protesters in Kiev were hired to protest by US and German financed NGOs.\nThe protests in Kiev were equally pointless, because presidential elections were only months away. If Ukrainians really believed that their president was conspiring with Russia to keep Ukraine from becoming a Western puppet state and wished to become a puppet state regardless of the costs, the opportunity to vote the government out was at hand. The only reason for the protests was to orchestrate a coup. The US did succeed in putting their agent in control of the new Ukrainian government as Victoria Nuland and the US ambassador in Kiev confirmed in their telephone conversation that is available on the Internet.\nThe Maidan protests were pointless except for making a coup possible. The protests were without any doubt arranged by Washington through Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, a neoconservative brought into the State Department by Hillary Clinton for the purpose of creating conflict with Russia.\nTrump is being protested in order to make him vulnerable in the event he proves to be the threat to the Oligarchy that he is thought to be.\nTrump won the presidency, but the Oligarchy is still in power, which makes any real reforms difficult to achieve. Symbolic reforms can be the product of the contest between President Trump and the oligarchs.\nKarl Marx learned from historical experience, and Lenin, Stalin, and Pol Pot learned from Karl Marx, that change cannot occur if the displaced ruling class is left intact after a revolution against them. We have proof of this throughout South America. Every revolution by the indigenous people has left unmolested the Spanish ruling class, and every revolution has been overthrown by collusion between the ruling class and Washington.\nWashington has conspired with traditional elites to remove the elected presidents of Honduras on a number of occasions. Recently, Washington helped elites evict the female presidents of Argentina and Brazil. The presidents of Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia are in the crosshairs and are unlikely to survive. Washington is determined to get its hands on Julian Assange. To achieve this Washington intends to overthrow the Ecuadoran government that, in defiance of Washington, gave Julian Assange political asylum.\nHugo Chavez had the power to exile or to exterminate the Spanish ruling class in Venezuela when the ruling class participated in a CIA coup against Chavez. But before the CIA could kill Chavez, the people and the military forced his release. Instead of punishing the criminals who would have murdered him, Chavez let them go.\nAccording to Marx, Lenin, and Stalin, this is the classic mistake of the revolutionary. To rely on good will from the overthrown ruling class is the certain road to the defeat of the revolution.\nLatin American has proved itself unable to learn this lesson: Revolutions cannot be conciliatory.\nTrump is a dealmaker. The Oligarchy can permit him the sheen of success in exchange for no real change.\nTrump is not perfect. He might fail on his own. But we should back him on the two most important elements in his program: to reduce tensions between the major nuclear powers, and to halt Washington’s policy of permitting globalism to destroy Americans’ economic prospects.\nIf tensions between nuclear powers worsen, we won’t be here to worry about other problems. The combination of the economy hollowed out by globalism and immigration is an economic nightmare. That Trump understands this is reason to support him.\nNote: Some believe that Trump is a ruse conducted by the Oligarchy. However, as Hillary is the bought-and-paid-for representative of the Oligarchy, such an elaborate ruse is unnecessary. It is preferable for the Oligarchy to win on its own platform than to install a president on the opposite platform and then change him around. Another sellout increases the anger of the people. If Hillary had won, the Oligarchy would have had the voters’ mandate for their platform.\nDr. Paul Craig Roberts was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy and associate editor of the Wall Street Journal. He was columnist for Business Week, Scripps Howard News Service, and Creators Syndicate. He has had many university appointments. His internet columns have attracted a worldwide following.

real = "Ted Cruz took first prize in the Iowa caucuses, but in the days before the New Hampshire primary, not many people are treating the Texas senator like a winner.\n\nInstead, the talk has turned to a clash between Marco Rubio and Donald Trump, the two front-runners in the Granite State, and how one has to lose a bit less than the other in order to claim victory. And whenever Cruz?s name comes up, it tends to be connected to accusations over the ?dirty tricks? he allegedly played to win Iowa. Now, with victory in New Hampshire looking increasingly unlikely, Cruz risks looking like a third wheel. Saturday?s Republican debate is a crucial opportunity for him to prevent that fate, but to do so, he just somehow swipe support from either Trump or Rubio.\n\nCruz goes into the debate with the curse of the Iowa winner looming over him: Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, fellow Christian conservatives who won the caucuses in the past two elections, both ended up losing the nomination. In those elections, the winner in New Hampshire ended up with the Republican nomination. While Trump is currently the front-runner, he also happens to be entirely unpredictable and apparently disinterested in running a coherent ground game. Cruz, on the other hand, has a strong campaign organization in New Hampshire, but is unlikely to win the state thanks to a Rubio surge?that is, unless the polls are misleading, as they were in Iowa.\n\nWinning Iowa at all costs has also put a target on Cruz?s back. In the wake of his victory come accusations from Trump and Ben Carson that the Cruz campaign cheated its way to first place, with Trump calling for the Iowa results to be invalidated and Cruz indicted for voter fraud. When Trump, with an assist from Carson, inevitably turns his wrath on Cruz on Saturday, he will attack the Texan?s integrity and cast him as a political sneak, a description that does tend to befit Cruz?s reputation. The rest of the candidates will likely tear at him, too, given his winner?s status in Iowa. (Luckily for Cruz, few people watch debates on a Saturday night.)\n\nBut most important, Cruz now faces two opponents whom he narrowly beat in Iowa, and who are setting themselves up for the showdown he wanted to participate in. The inevitability of his loss in New Hampshire?polls already show him dropping after Rubio?s Iowa performance?has set up the renegade Trump in one corner, and the establishment Rubio in the other. Though Cruz has long trumpeted his own ideological purity, Trump has staked out voters to the far right, while Rubio increasingly fortifies his own position in the center thanks to a bevy of endorsements, leaving Cruz as the man uncertainly, nebulously floating somewhere in between.\n\nFor Cruz, his goal on Saturday is not just survival, but to remind the nation that he continues to be relevant as Rubio and Trump suit up for the colossal, intra-party philosophical clash that has loomed over the Republican primary. But barring a moment on the stage where Trump or Rubio utterly, completely collapse, Cruz, the man who won over Iowans with his religious zeal, may find himself, like Huckabee and Santorum before him, a bit player strutting and fretting upon the debate stage, and nothing more.".replace('\n', '')
real2 = "ROME ?  U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders met privately with Pope Francis on Saturday, the capstone to an unusual detour from the American election.\n\nSanders said the meeting was for personal reasons and does not constitute an endorsement from the Holy See.\n\n\"I am an enormous fan of the pope because I think he has played a transformative role in the world in talking about issues that very rarely get the kind of discussion they deserve,\" Sanders said in an interview aboard his chartered plane. \"Whether it is income and wealth inequality, whether it is what he calls the dispossessed, the young people, the old people, the unemployed people who are on the sidelines of society, whether it is the ideology of greed, whether it is need to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to save the planet, he has been a transformative leader.\n\n\"And he is a very beautiful man,\" Sanders continued. \"When you meet him, you see something very, very special in his face. He is a man of peace, and you see that.\"\n\nSome of Sanders's advisers, including his wife, Jane, also were at the meeting. He said that there was no discussion of his underdog candidacy or the election. There was no photograph of the brief meeting at the papal residence complex, in keeping with Vatican protocol and also, Sanders said, \"to make clear that there is no endorsement here.\"\n\nFrancis, on Saturday, made it clear that his meeting with Sanders was not political, saying that those who thought it was should ?look for a psychiatrist,? according to Reuters.\n\nThe pontiff met Sanders at the Vatican guest house, where the pope lives. ?When I came down, I greeted him, I shook his hand and nothing more. This is called good manners and it is not getting involved in politics,? Reuters says the pope told reporters, during an answer to a question aboard the plane returning from the Greek island of Lesbos, where he visited a refugee camp.\n\n[Pope calls for compassion for refugees, takes three families back to Italy]\n\n?If anyone thinks that greeting someone is getting involved in politics, I recommend that he look for a psychiatrist,? he reportedly said while laughing.\n\nSanders was at the Vatican, participating in a seminar on income inequality and economic justice at the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, where he was invited to attend as well as speak. He and other conference invitees spent the night at the Vatican after the conference.\n\nThe trip suggests that Sanders is looking ahead to how he would continue and expand the focus on very liberal social justice issues that has defined his candidacy. In a matter of months he moved from gadfly to serious challenger to the longtime Democratic favorite, largely on the strength of a set of ideas more common to liberal university campuses than the political debate stage.\n\n\"If elected president I certainly would look forward to working with the pope in trying to create a moral economy, which was the theme of this conference; an economy which challenges the idea that greed has got to be the dominant force in the world's economy,\" Sanders said.\n\nAnd if he loses?\n\n\"Well, the ideas and the efforts remain the same. I'm a United States senator from Vermont. And I'll continue to fight the fights that I've always fought,\" with a larger platform to do so, Sanders said.\n\nThe Vatican invitation is symbolic of that platform, he agreed. But Sanders and the pontiff share many goals for social justice and economic restructuring, and Sanders suggested that, and not his candidacy, was the reason for the audience with Francis.\n\n\"The speech that I gave yesterday would have been the speech 10 years ago, long before I ever dreamed of running for president,\" he said in an interview with The Washington Post.\n\nSanders said the trip was \"absolutely\" a worthwhile diversion from campaigning in New York, where he trails front-runner Hillary Clinton by double digits in most polls.\n\n\"Look, we have campaigned extraordinarily hard in New York,\" Sanders said. He claimed he has addressed 96,000 people across the state at rallies and other meetings. \"We have worked very hard and when we go back, we're gonna work hard. This was an invitation that I would never have forgiven myself if I had refused.\"\n\nSanders needs a solid showing in New York, which offers more than 200 delegates, to maintain a plausible argument that he can catch up to Clinton. His path to the nomination has grown narrower even as he has defeated Clinton in a string of contests over the past month.\n\n\"Uh, we got a shot,\" Sanders said when asked about his prospects for Tuesday's primary vote. \"It's gonna be tough for us, not just because Clinton has won two elections there, but because of the nature of the voting rules.\"\n\nNew York, which Clinton represented as a senator for eight years, allows only registered Democrats to vote in the Democratic primary, meaning independents are cut out. Sanders has been regularly defeating Clinton among independents. The state also does not allow same-day registration. Sanders said he disagrees with both rules.\n\n\"Those are the rules. They don't work for us,\" Sanders said. \"But nonetheless, if there is a large voter turnout, we got a shot to win this.\"\n\nSanders flew to Rome on a large, chartered airliner, largely paid with campaign funds, spokesman Michael Briggs said.\n\nHe said he did not know the exact cost of the trip. News organizations flying with Sanders pay for their passage, and the Secret Service also pays a share.\n\nSanders has taken some criticism earlier in his campaign for using chartered aircraft ? a luxury for the privileged class as well as an addition to carbon emissions ? while railing against the excesses of the wealthiest top 1 percent of Americans.\n\nSeveral of Sanders?s advisers, along with his wife, their four children and four of their grandchildren, accompanied him for the overnight visit to Rome. While Jane Sanders attended the conference with her husband and joined him in meeting the pope, the rest of the family spent time sightseeing. The trip also included a stay at a posh hotel.\n\nSanders was back on the plane Saturday, as he plans to campaign in Brooklyn in the evening.\n\nStefano Pitrelli in Rome contributed to this report.".replace('\n', '')
real3 = "Most conservatives who oppose marriage equality will cite the Bible, ?nature,? or polygamy and incest to justify their opposition.\n\nBut for one Alabama state senator, a reason to oppose marriage equality is that it would allow same-sex couples to receive the same financial benefits that different-sex couples currently receive.\n\n?You gotta look at the financial aspect of this as well,? State Sen. Del Marsh (R) told radio host Dale Jackson last week. ?Let?s face it. If gay marriage is approved, I assume that those types of unions, those people would be entitled to Social Security benefits, insurance. Where does it end??\n\nContrary to Marsh?s claim that the financial impact of marriage equality would be devastating, studies have shown that it would be a boon for the economy. Indeed, in 2004 the Congressional Budget Office weighed the potential increased spending on Social Security and other benefits against the increased savings from other programs like Medicare and Medicaid. They found that if all states were to legalize marriage equality, it would boost the federal budget by $10 billion over 10 years. Other reports have found that legalizing marriage equality would improve state budgets as well. The Williams Institute estimates that marriage equality would add $21.7 million to Alabama?s economy over the first three years.\n\nAlabama?s opponents of marriage equality were left scrambling after a judge ruled two weeks ago that the state?s ban on same-sex marriage violated both Equality Protection and Due Process protections. The decision is temporarily stayed, pending appeal. It is set to take effect on February 9th.\n\nMarsh was first elected to the Alabama State Senate in 1998.

David Perdue, a freshman senator from Georgia, opened his remarks at the Faith & Freedom Coalition?s Road to Majority conference by encouraging attendees to pray for President Obama. But, he added in a joking tone, they need to pray for him in a very specific way: ?We should pray for him like Psalms 109:8 says: Let his days be few, and let another have his office,? the senator said, smiling wryly.\n\nThe rest of that passage, which Perdue did not recite, reads, ?May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow. May his children be wandering beggars; may they be driven from their ruined homes.?\n\n?Let the creditor seize all that he has, and let strangers plunder his labor. Let there be none to extend mercy to him, nor let there be any to favor his fatherless children. Let his posterity be cut off, and in the generation following let their name be blotted out,? it continues.\n\nPerdue?s joke drew immediate criticism. Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, tweeted, ?Republican Senator David Perdue is praying for President Obama to die. This is why Trump is the GOP nominee.?\n\nAs the Washington Post?s Dave Weigel pointed out, conservatives have long invoked this verse in the yearning for an end to Obama?s days in office. A Christian Science Monitor report from November 16, 2009, detailed the popularity of bumper stickers that read simply, ?Pray for Obama: Psalm 109:8.?\n\nThe Road to Majority conference brings together top leaders in the social-conservative world, as well as prominent elected Republicans. Shortly after Perdue?s speech, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and top Trump adviser Sen. Jeff Sessions spoke. Donald Trump will keynote the event later today.\n\n?Senator Perdue said we are called to pray for our country, for our leaders, and for our president.

real5 = "The State Department told the Republican National Committee that it could not find any emails to or from Hillary Clinton's former IT specialist, who managed her private email server during her tenure as secretary of state before going on to work for the agency, according to a court filing made public Monday.\n\n\n\nThe government's revelation in U.S. District Court in Washington came in answer to a lawsuit by the Republican National Committee. The RNC had sued over its public records request for all work-related emails sent to or received by Clinton's former aide, Bryan Pagliano, between 2009 and 2013, the years of Clinton's tenure as America's top diplomat. The lawsuit also pressed for other State Department records from the Clinton era.\n\nThe RNC's filing said lawyers for the agency had informed them in discussions that \"the State Department has represented that no responsive records exist\" for any Pagliano emails. Pagliano was hired at the agency after reportedly setting up Clinton's server in 2009, but the lack of any official State Department emails raises the question whether he limited his email traffic using a private account, much like Clinton did during her four years as secretary, or whether his government emails were deleted.\n\n\n\nA State Department official said Monday that the agency possessed emails from Pagliano from the period after Clinton's term had ended, when he continued to work as a technology contractor.\n\nAgency spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau then added Monday evening that some Pagliano emails dating from Clinton's tenure had been recovered from agency officials' files and turned over to other organizations, including Senate investigators.\n\n\n\n\"We have previously produced through FOIA and to Congress emails sent and received by Mr. Pagliano during Secretary Clinton's tenure,\" Trudeau said in a public statement. At least one email, which was sent in November 2012 to Clinton from Pagliano -- but possibly from his private email address -- was released as part of 30,000 Clinton emails made public by the agency over the past year.\n\n\n\nA spokesman for the RNC said the organization stood by its description of the discussions with lawyers for the State Department. The group said in its filing that \"the State Department has represented that no responsive records exist.\"\n\n\n\nRaj Shah, the RNC spokesman, added, \"It's hard to believe that an IT staffer who set up Hillary Clinton's reckless email server never sent or received a single work-related email in the four years he worked at the State Department.\" Clinton's campaign officials declined to comment in response to questions from The Associated Press.\n\n\n\nTrudeau said the State Department is working with Congress and several public records requesters to provide relevant material. She also said agency officials continue to search for \"Mr. Pagliano's emails, which the department may have otherwise retained.\" Trudeau also said the department would respond further to the RNC in court.\n\n\n\nState Department officials told Senate investigators last year they could not find a file containing Pagliano's work emails during Clinton's tenure, an assertion first reported by Politico.\n\n\n\nFox News reported in March that Pagliano has revealed several details about Clinton's personal email system to investigators, including who had access to it? as well as when and what devices were used. An intelligence source close to the case told Fox News that Pagliano has been a \"devastating witness\" to Clinton.\n\nThe one email sent by Pagliano that surfaced among Clinton's 30,000 emails was sent to Clinton was a November 2012 birthday greeting. He wished her \"Happy Birthday Madam Secretary. To many more!\"\n\n\n\nPagliano's email address was censored, unlike numerous official State Department addresses that are listed in Clinton's emails -- suggesting he may have sent the message from a private address.\n\nClinton did not reply directly to Pagliano.

real6 = "ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia ?President Obama convened a meeting with the leaders of several East African nations and the African Union on Monday in an effort to address the worsening situation in South Sudan, even as he met with Ethiopia?s prime minister to discuss how to strengthen human rights and democratic institutions here.\n\nWith no resolution in sight for the ongoing conflict in South Sudan, Obama brought together top officials from Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Sudan and the A.U. to chart out a strategy in the event that the latest round of peace talks fail.\n\nAfrican nations, led by Ethiopia, have been trying to broker a peace in South Sudan through the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), a regional body, and are almost ready to present a possible compromise to the warring parties. The two sides will have until Aug. 17 to respond to the proposal, but administration officials have little expectation that they will accept it.\n\nOn Monday, Obama praised the regional leaders for showing ?extraordinary leadership in trying to address the continuing situation in South Sudan.? The group included Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, African Union Chairperson Dlamini Zuma and Sudan?s minister of foreign affairs, Ibrahim Ghandour.\n\n?This gives me and the U.S. delegation an opportunity to learn from them what progress has been made, where there appears to be continued roadblocks and how we can partner with them to make progress,? Obama said. ?Our hope is that we can actually bring about the kind of peace that the people of South Sudan so desperately need.?\n\nThe question of South Sudan ? a nation that the United States helped bring into existence in 2011 after years of effort by both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations ? has vexed American policymakers for years.\n\nIn December 2013, South Sudan President Salva Kiir accused Riek Machar, who had served as his vice president, of attempting a coup d?etat. The two had been longtime political rivals from different ethnic groups ? Kiir is Dinka, Machar is a Nuer ? who had come together to form a government when the country was first created.\n\nWhile tribal differences have helped fuel the conflict, the war has been largely focused on control of the nation?s oil fields, South Sudan?s primary source of revenue.\n\nPrinceton Lyman, U.S. special envoy for Sudan and South Sudan from 2011 to 2013, noted that when he first took over as envoy, the United States had spent $10 billion on peacekeeping and other assistance for the two nations, ?and that was four years ago? This is a big investment,? he added.\n\nAt this point, more than 2.5 million people are facing food shortages, while roughly 1.5 million are displaced from their homes. An additional 520,000 South Sudanese have fled across the border into neighboring countries, including Ethiopia.\n\nThe conflict also poses a major economic problem for Kenya, which had major investments in South Sudan before the fighting broke out. The LAPSSET Corridor project was aimed at transporting oil from South Sudan to the Kenyan port of Lamu, and according to E.J. Hogendoorn, deputy program director for Africa at the International Crisis Group, the planned transportation and infrastructure development could have been an ?engine of development\" for many parts of East Africa. \"Unfortunately, of course, that?s on hold because of the war,? he said.\n\nWhile Obama spent part of the afternoon addressing a regional conflict in Africa, he devoted the rest of the day to strengthening ties with Ethiopia, whose alliance with the United States dates back more than a century. But the current government has come under sharp criticism for its treatment of political opponents and journalists.\n\nObama is the first sitting U.S. president to visit Ethiopia.\n\nIn a news conference Monday afternoon, both Obama and Hailemariam said they had a frank discussion about Ethiopia's human rights practices and the need for improvement. Ethiopia is Africa?s number two jailer of journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and its ruling party won 100 percent of the seats in May?s parliamentary elections.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Susan Rice, asked last week whether she considered Ethiopia a democracy, replied, with irony: ?One hundred percent.?\n\nBut during the news conference Obama twice referred to the Ethiopian government as ?democratically elected.?\n\n?I don?t bite my tongue,? Obama said of raising concerns on these issues with Ethiopia. ?But I do so from a position of respect.?\n\nHailemariam, for his part, said, ?Our commitment to democracy is real, not skin deep.?\n\nBut he added later that people could not expect sweeping reforms given the fact that military rule ended just a couple of decades ago. ?Something has to be understood: This is a fledgling democracy.?\n\nThe two leaders also discussed their collaboration on counterterrorism, an area in which Ethiopia has been an active leader. The White House announced Monday it will ?work with Congress to provide approximately $465 million? this year in new training, equipment and capacity-building aid to its African allies.\n\nThe administration also said it would provide at least $40 million in assistance this fiscal year to combat violent extremism in East Africa. The money is intended to foster collaboration among security forces, law enforcement, government officials, community leaders and members of civil society, officials said.\n\nObama praised Ethiopia?s work to curb extremist activity but noted that its government had labeled some opposition groups as posing a greater threat than U.S. intelligence would indicate. ?Our intelligence indicates while they may oppose the government, they have not tipped into terrorism,? he said.\n\nThe United States provides more than $600 million in assistance to Ethiopia annually. The vast bulk of that ? $490 million ? comes from the U.S. Agency for International Development, while the rest is largely security-related. Last fiscal year, nearly $200 million went to health programs, while $163 million went to humanitarian aid.\n\nObama said Ethiopia ?has proven itself a global leader? on development and over the past 15 years ?has lifted millions of people out of poverty.?\n\n?To many people around the world, their image of Ethiopia remains stuck in the past, remembering drought and famine,? he said.\n\nThe two leaders appeared to have a friendly rapport throughout the news conference. Hailemariam described his country as scoring a series of firsts: Along with being ?the cradle of mankind,? he said, ?Ethiopia is the birthplace of coffee.? That elicited a smile from Obama.\n\nObama said he was impressed by the Ethiopian?s unusual pets. ?I had a chance to see the famous lions that live on the grounds,\" he said. \"I?m considering getting some for the White House.? But he conceded that before he did that, ?I?ll have to make sure my dogs are safe.?".replace('\n', '')

And so they were doing this act, sent out the tweet in advance because if they know there's a possibility they're not going to make it out of this, then they can't give recognition to what they were trying to do after the fact.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest described what happened as \"an attempted terrorist act (that) was foiled.\" U.S. authorities, meanwhile, are still looking into what links -- if any -- Sunday's shooters had to international terrorism.\n\nBut there are clues that one of the gunmen was an ISIS sympathizer.\n\nMoments before the attack, Simpson posted a tweet with the hashtag #texasattack: \"May Allah accept us as mujahideen.\"\n\nThe tweet also said he and his fellow attacker had pledged allegiance to \"Amirul Mu'mineen,\" which means \"the leader of the faithful.\" CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said that likely refers to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nEarlier, Simpson had asked his followers on Twitter to follow an ISIS propagandist.\n\nAfter the shooting, the propagandist tweeted: \"Allahu Akbar!!!! 2 of our brothers just opened fire.\"\n\nBoth Twitter accounts have been deactivated.\n\nOne U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the shooting was \"certainly more than just inspiration\" by ISIS, but that assessment does not mean the terror group gave the gunmen specific instructions.\n\nA law enforcement official told CNN the attack does not appear to be a clear-cut case of a lone wolf, nor a pure case of someone directed by others to act. Rather, the official said, it appears to be something in between the two extremes.\n\nThe attack fits a well-known pattern of ISIS recruitment and incitement: encouraging sympathizers via a sophisticated social media campaign to join the fight in Syria, or, if they cannot, to carry out terror attacks on their own at home, U.S. officials said Tuesday.\n\nIn 2011, Simpson was convicted of making a false statement involving international and domestic terrorism. Prosecutors said he told FBI agents he had not discussed traveling to Somalia to engage in \"violent jihad\" -- when, in fact, he had, according to an indictment.\n\nSimpson was sentenced to three years of probation, court records show.\n\nSoofi, on the other hand, was relatively unknown to federal investigators, a law enforcement official told CNN.\n\nAuthorities knew of no indication the pair planned to launch Sunday's attack, another law enforcement official said.\n\nTwo law enforcement officials say that it's believed Simpson and Soofie drove from Phoenix, Arizona, to Garland, but officials did not specify the exact timeline of when the trip was made.\n\nA separate law enforcement source said the two long guns and four handguns found in their car were bought legally.\n\nThe FBI searched the apartment Simpson and Soofie shared and found it to be relatively barren, one of the law enforcement officials said. Authorities retrieved a hard drive, which is being analyzed, the official said.\n\nInvestigators are trying to ascertain whether the two gunmen had any associates in Phoenix, or across the United States, who share their ideology. The FBI is scrubbing the deceased attackers' electronics and interviewing friends in a bid to draw possible connections.\n\nThe two assailants drove up to the center and started shooting, striking a security guard in the ankle. But Garland police returned fire, killing the gunmen before they were able to enter the building.\n\nPolice \"faced death head-on and, with incredible skill and bravery, were able to save a lot of people,\" said Zach Horn, an attorney for the officers.\n\nThe shooting stirred memories of other attacks this year in France and Denmark.\n\nIn January, gunmen attacked the offices of Charlie Hebdo, a French satirical magazine that has a controversial history of depicting Mohammed, and killed 12 people.\n\nIn February, a gunman attacked a free speech forum in Copenhagen, Denmark, featuring artist Lars Vilks, who infuriated al Qaeda with his depictions of Mohammed.".replace('\n', '')
real8 = "It was inevitable that liberals would end up being condemned for the horrific attacks on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hedbo in which 12 people were killed by what appear to have been Muslim extremists. Yes, I know it seems strange on the face of it that anyone would think liberals would be responsible for the actions of ultra-conservative religious fanatics, but this is nothing new. It goes all the way back to the capture of John Walker Lind, the ?American Taliban,? when conservative wags such as Ann Coulter declared that he naturally became a member of that violent, conservative religious sect because he was raised in Marin County, California, and was thus a liberal role model:\n\nConservative writer Andrew Sullivan famously issued this indictment, just five days after 9/11:\n\nIt never struck these people as odd that liberals ? the coalition that includes feminists, gays and promotes religious pluralism, including atheism ? would throw in with conservative fundamentalists, but there it is.\n\nSullivan later apologized for his remarks. I?m sure you?ll be shocked to learn that Coulter did not.\n\nThis idea never really went away, however. It?s as if some people cannot conceptualize the idea that their enemies might not be in cahoots with one another. Even gay-loving atheists and jihadis, which has to be one of the oddest alliances of all time. It took on a slightly different cast when the Danish cartoon controversy erupted back in 2006. At that time, the right was very critical of the left for allegedly failing to throw the blasphemous and insulting cartoons in the jihadists? faces and show proper regard for Western notions of free speech by telling Muslims everywhere in no uncertain terms what they could do with their prohibition on images of the Prophet Mohammed. William Kristol of the Weekly Standard put it this way:\n\nHe was including that liberal squish George W. Bush in his criticism, by the way. His state department had issued a statement condemning the cartoons as being ?unacceptable.?\n\nFast forward to the horrific events of this week in Paris and we?ll see the same refrain. Liberals are once again at least partially responsible for the terrible acts of what appear to be ultra-conservative fanatics because they have failed to properly defend free speech.\n\nYesterday, Jonathan Chait in New York magazine quoted the Time magazine Paris bureau chief Bruce Crumley in the wake of the earlier firebombing of Charlie Hebdo in 2010, angrily condemning what he called ??majority sections? of Western nations to bait Muslim members with petulant, futile demonstrations that ?they? aren?t going to tell ?us? what can and can?t be done in free societies?? He was obviously talking about the attitudes and practices of Islamophobes throughout Europe, but did take the magazine to task for its overall offensiveness as well.\n\nChait sarcastically says, ?Crumley carefully noted, terrorism is bad, too. But his primary villain was the satirical magazine that provoked the attacks.? Oddly, later in the piece he quotes Crumley saying that societies cannot give in to the hysterical demands of extremists and that violence and intimidation cannot be condoned, but his point seems to be that beyond that any discussion or disagreement with the substance of the free speech in question is off limits.\n\nHe?s not speaking of liberalism in the parochial American sense, obviously, but the criticism hits the same people. He goes on to quote Jay Carney, Obama?s former press secretary, who very mildly pointed out at the time that insulting depictions of the Prophet Mohammed are entirely legal but that publishing them showed questionable judgment and concludes:\n\nThe Muslim radical argues that the ban on blasphemy is morally right and should be followed; the Western liberal insists it is morally wrong but should be followed. Theoretical distinctions aside, both positions yield an identical outcome. The right to blaspheme religion is one of the most elemental exercises of political liberalism. One cannot defend the right without defending the practice. So much for that old American trope about freedom of speech: ?I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.? By defending the ?practice,? he apparently means we are also obligated to refrain from objecting to what people say as well, which is a very different proposition. This essentially says that in defending freedom of speech you must give up your own right to free speech lest you help the terrorists ? which is a bit strange. And it?s a concept over which the great right-wing defenders of American values are going to find themselves in conflict. After all, the shoe was on their religious feet not that long ago: NEW YORK, Sept. 23?He?s particularly outraged, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has said, by a collage of the Virgin Mary dotted with elephant dung. He isn?t impressed by the pickled pig carcasses, either. And he?s taken dead aim at the Brooklyn Museum of Art: It will lose $7 million in city funds, he warns, unless it cancels a ?sick? exhibit of British works scheduled to open next week. Rome?s Catholic, Muslim and Jewish leaders have united to condemn pop star Madonna?s decision to stage a mock-crucifixion when she performs in the Italian capital on Sunday a stone?s throw away from Vatican City. The lapsed-Catholic diva?s latest irreverent performance sees her wearing a fake crown of thorns and descending on a suspended, glittery cross as part of her worldwide ?Confessions Tour?. Having already been criticised in the United States, Catholics priests from across the Eternal City have gone one further saying the act is blasphemy. Cardinal Ersilio Tonino, speaking with the approval of Pope Benedict XVI said: ?This time the limits have really been pushed too far. ?This concert is a blashphemous challenge to the faith and a profanation of the cross. She should be excommunicated.? In an unusual show of religious solidarity, Muslim and Jewish leaders added their condemnation of the self-styled Queen of Pop, famous for peppering her concerts and videos with controversial religious and sexual imagery. ?I think her idea is in the worst taste and she?d do better to go home,? Mario Scialoja, head of Italy?s Muslim League said. People get upset about things people say and often condemn them for saying it because it?s offensive to them or others. It?s certainly not an exclusively liberal thing unless you think that fundamentalist Islam is liberal or that conservative Catholics like Rudy Giuliani and Pope Benedict are left-wingers. (But it must be noted that in all the situations outlined here, the only person to use the power of the state to try to shut anyone up was Rudy Giuliani.) Arthur Goldhammer wrote a very insightful piece about this latest horror in Al Jazeera. He pointed out that Charlie Hedbo was more than just a satirical magazine. It followed a certain unique French tradition that was ?an equal opportunity offender, and it reveled in its freedom to vex, irritate and derange.? It?s doubtful many people would feel it necessary to defend the substance of everything in its pages ? how could they without having their heads explode? No, what we must defend is the principle under which they were allowed to say what they said, period. That is inviolable. And that principle also allows people to condemn Islam or Charlie Hedbo  ? or both in the very same breath. Once you start policing what people say in the name of free speech you?ve already lost the argument. And yes, under that principle, we must also defend William Donohue?s right to say the cretinous, idiotic things he says. And we can certainly also feel free to condemn him for saying it. In doing so, we are not advocating that he be silenced. We are using our right of free speech to say we think he?s a cretinous idiot and we wish he would stop being one.".replace('\n', '')
real9 = "Police in Charleston, S.C., say a man they suspect opened fire and killed nine people during a Wednesday prayer meeting at one of the city's oldest historically black churches has been captured.\n\nPolice are calling the attack a hate crime, and they released stills from a security video that authorities say show 21-year-old Dylann Roof entering the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\nRoof, police said, sat with the congregation for about an hour before he opened fire at around 9 p.m. ET. He left the church in a black sedan, unleashing an overnight manhunt that involved local and federal law enforcement.\n\nPolice apprehended the lone suspect during a traffic stop in Shelby, N.C., an almost four-hour drive from Charleston. Roof waived extradition during a court appearance in Shelby and will be headed back to South Carolina.\n\nCharleston Mayor Joseph Riley said the arrest is a part of the healing process that has just begun.\n\n\"In America we don't let people like this get away with this dastardly deed,\" Riley said.\n\nIn a statement from the White House, President Obama meditated on the history of the church, which he called a \"sacred place in the history of Charleston and in the history of America.\"\n\nHe said the Emanuel AME is a church that has seen tragedy in the past. It was burned to the ground because its worshippers wanted to end slavery. It's a place where civil rights leaders spoke and led marches in search for freedom.\n\nObama said it's a tragedy anytime Americans die in a situation like this, but it's especially heartbreaking when it happens \"at a place where people are seeking peace.\"\n\nObama quoted a eulogy Martin Luther King Jr. delivered at the funeral service for three of the four children who were killed in the 1963 bombing of a Baptist church in Birmingham.\n\nIn death, King said, those three little girls told America \"that we must be concerned not merely about who murdered them, but about the system, the way of life, the philosophy which produced the murderers.\"\n\nAt an earlier press conference, Charleston Police Chief Gregory Mullen said: \"It is senseless, it is unfathomable, that in today's society somebody would walk into a church, into a prayer meeting, and take lives.\"\n\nState Sen. Clementa C. Pinckney, who was also the senior pastor at Emanuel AME Church, was one of the people killed during the attack.\n\nThe President Pro Tempore of South Carolina's Senate, Hugh Leatherman, said Pinckney was \"a strong advocate for his constituents, a great pastor and community leader, but most importantly, a cherished and loved husband, father and son.\"\n\nHe continued: \"The victims were in a Bible study, learning the Word of God, in one of the most beloved institutions in our State whose roots go back to the dark days of slavery. What happened last night is incomprehensible.\"\n\nThe Charleston County coroner identified the nine victims as Cynthia Hurd, 54; Daniel Simmons Sr., 74; Rev. Clementa Pinckney, 41; Rev. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45; Ethel Lance, 70; Tywanza Sanders, 26; Myra Thompson, 59; Susie Jackson, 87; and Depayne Middleton Doctor, 49. All the victims, but Simmons, died at the scene. Simmons died in hospital.\n\nIn a short speech at the White House, President Obama said that he was restrained by what he could say about the facts of case, but he was not constrained by emotion.\n\nObama said that it is tragic anytime Americans die in a situation like this. But it is especially heartbreaking when it happens \"at a place where people are seeking peace.\"\n\nHe said the Emanuel AME is a church that has seen tragedy in the past. It was burned to the ground because its worshippers wanted to end slavery. It's a place where civil rights leaders spoke and led marches in search for freedom.\n\n\"This is a sacred place in the history of Charleston and in the history of America,\" Obama said.\n\nToday, he said, marks another attempt against a black church in the United States. And like this church, and others like it, have rebuilt in the past, Mother Emanuel \"will rise again, now.\"\n\nUpdate at 12 p.m. ET. Tip Led To Arrest:\n\nDuring a news conference, Charleston Police Chief Gregory Mullen said a civilian called police to report suspicious activity.\n\nPolice followed up on the tip and quickly figured out that they were dealing with shooting suspect Dylann Roof, who was arrested without incident.\n\nMullen, who would not comment on whether Roof had any weapons on him, said that Roof was cooperative.\n\nMullen said that police had yet to determine a motive.\n\nUpdate at 11:13 a.m. ET. Barbaric Crime:\n\n\"Acts like this one have no place in our country and no place in a civilized society,\" she said.\n\nLynch said that federal authorities are working closely with local authorities to try to apprehend the suspect.\n\nPresident Obama is expected to make a statement at 11:45 a.m. ET.\n\nUpdate at 11:10 a.m. ET. Two Previous Arrests:\n\nA search of public records finds that Dylann Roof had two recent court cases against him ? one for trespassing, one for drug possession.\n\nUpdate at 10:33 a.m. ET. Suspect Identified:\n\nThe city of Charleston said police have named a suspect: 21-year-old Dylann Roof.\n\n\"The vehicle he may be driving is a black Hyundai with vehicle tag LGF330. Anyone with information about his location call 1-800-CALL-FBI,\" the city said in a statement.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups, tweeted a photograph of the suspect sporting a jacket with what appears to be the flag for \"white-rule Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe.\"\n\nAnother patch on the jacket, the SPLC says, shows a South African apartheid era flag.\n\nUpdate at 9:35 a.m. ET. A 'Beloved Senator':\n\nThe President Pro Tempore of South Carolina Senate, Hugh Leatherman, said Sen. Pinckney was a \"beloved\" public servant.\n\n\"Senator Clementa C. Pinckney was a leader in the Senate of South Carolina, a strong advocate for his constituents, a great pastor and community leader, but most importantly, a cherished and loved husband, father and son,\" Leatherman said in a statement. \"The entire Senate of South Carolina extends our love and sympathy to Jennifer, Eliana, Malana, and to the rest of his family.\"\n\nUpdate at 9:05 a.m. ET. State Senator Among Those Killed:\n\nState Sen. Clementa C. Pinckney, who was also the senior pastor at Emanuel AME Church, was one of the people killed during the attack, according to multiple news outlets as well as the chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party.\n\nUpdate at 8:43 a.m. ET. Federal Hate Crime Investigation:\n\nUpdate at 7:17 a.m. ET. Suspect Sat With Congregation For An Hour:\n\nDuring a press conference just minutes ago, Charleston Police Chief Gregory Mullen said the suspect sat with the congregation in prayer for about an hour before opening fire.\n\nThe suspect ultimately killed 9 people ? six females and three males. Three others survived.\n\nMullen said that law enforcement from all along the East Coast are helping in the investigation and the FBI and the ATF have come in from D.C.\n\n\"This tragedy that we're addressing right now is indescribable,\" Mullen said. \"No one in this community will ever forget this night ... and because of the pain and the hurt this individual has caused this community ... the law enforcement officials working on this are committed and we will catch this individual.\"\n\nMullen called on anyone with information about the suspect to call 1-800-Call-FBI, but said that they should not approach the suspect because he is \"very dangerous.\"\n\nCharleston Mayor Joseph Riley Jr. said that last night that he and the police chief \"hugged as many\" of the victims' families as they could. He said they saw weeping mothers, fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers.\n\nRiley said this attack has ripped a part of the community's fabric forever.\n\n\"But we will work to heal them, to love them and support them in that church as long as we live,\" Riley said.\n\nUpdate at 6:50 a.m. ET. What Happened?\n\nAccording to The Post and Courier of Charleston, a gunman entered the church on Wednesday evening, as members of the church gathered for a prayer meeting.\n\nThe Emanuel AME Church website says that church is the oldest African Methodist Episcopal church in the South. \"Emanuel has one of the largest and oldest black congregations south of Baltimore, Maryland,\" the website says.".replace('\n', '')
real10 = "Silver of FiveThirtyEight.com has laid out four possible outcomes to the race at this point, with all but one featuring a Clinton win:\n\nA Trump win, including cases where he loses the popular vote but wins the Electoral College. A narrow Clinton win, wherein she wins the Electoral College, but wins the popular vote by 3 percentage points or less. (Or wins the Electoral College and loses the popular vote.) A Clinton win in the ?Obama zone,? wherein she wins the popular vote by 4 to 7 percentage points ? the margins by which President Obama won the elections in 2012 and 2008, respectively. Clinton is all but certain to win the Electoral College if she wins the popular vote by this amount. Finally, a Clinton blowout, wherein she wins the popular vote by 8 points or more, which would almost certainly also yield a dominant performance in the Electoral College.\n\nFiveThirtyEight?s model, which averages polls, shows that Clinton has an 85 percent probability of winning and is currently ahead by 6.6 points.\n\nFor its part, The New York Times Upshot has a 92 percent probability of a Clinton win and shows see side-by-side comparisons of all the predictions. They all have Clinton with 85 percent or higher. Using its customary metaphor, the Upshot compares the chances of Clinton losing ?to the probability that an NFL kicker misses a 29-yard field goal.? That indeed happens (in fact, it happened on Sunday night) so Democrats should not get complacent.\n\nAnd for down ballot races? Well, there always has been a decent possibility that the Democrats would win the Senate if they retain the White House, simply because this is a cycle when Republicans are defending more seats. Still, that outcome is anything but assured, and some analysts are insisting (without evidence) that this year will feature lots of ticket splitting (that is, people who vote for Clinton but also vote for a Republican incumbent senator, for example).\n\nStill, this cycle is nothing if not unpredictable, so who knows?\n\nDemocrats had written off the House from the beginning: GOP gerrymandering all over the country makes it nearly impossible for Democrats to win a majority in the House until another round of redistricting after the 2020 census. Still, the possibility, however remote, is starting to be discussed.\n\nSam Wang from the Princeton Election Consortium said:\n\nI estimate that Democrats must win the national popular vote by 8% to have any chance at taking control of the House. This large margin is driven by two major factors in equal measure: gerrymandering to pack Democrats into districts, and population patterns which they pack themselves. Therefore the magic number for House Democrats is a Clinton win by 8%. In national polls Clinton is currently ahead by 5% (7 polls starting on October 10th or later), and Obama outperformed his 2012 polls by 3%, so it?s not crazy to imagine. I?d give the House Democrats a 1 in 5 chance of making it over this bar. A long shot . . . but not a crazy long shot.\n\nSo what?s happening to make this dramatic shift in October? Clinton had been leading throughout the summer, but on Sept. 26, the day of the first debate, FiveThirtyEight had Donald Trump with a 51 percent chance of winning. The candidates were tied nationally at 45 percent, and the trend was moving in his favor. The obvious answer is that Trump blew it when he made a fool of himself in the aftermath of the first debate with his 3 a.m. tweets about the former Miss Universe. Since then he has been accused by a dozen women of groping and assaulting them against their will. That ?Access Hollywood? tape was a shocker. Most observers see the huge and growing gender gap as a result of all that grossness. But something else happened as well. For about a month before that first debate the right-wing media and people in or around the Trump campaign had been spreading spurious rumors that Clinton had brain damage or Parkinson?s disease. This was barely covered in the mainstream media, but everyone in the media pays attention to Matt Drudge, who had been relentless with the story, so they were very much aware of such rumors. When Clinton had her fainting spell at the 9/11 ceremony in New York, the press spent days feigning anger about her failure to keep them properly informed about the details of her doctor?s appointments and diagnosis. (That?s despite campaign professionals saying they would never inform the press of anything like that, mainly because such illnesses are so common on the trail.) Unfortunately for Clinton, the combined effect of the right?s relentless smears about some kind of disqualifying terminal illness and the press fulminating for days over her pneumonia advanced the idea that she lacked the ?strength and stamina? required for the job. Coincidentally or otherwise, this was the very charge that Trump had been making for months. By the time of the first debate in late September Clinton had been off the trail for quite a bit, first recovering from her pneumonia and then doing debate prep, with Trump nipping at her heels. When she showed up looking very healthy, sharp and aggressive, it changed the narrative overnight. Indeed, her ability to bait him into misbehavior had her dominating that debate from beginning to end, when she hit him with the Alicia Machado story that had him reeling for days afterward. So it?s true that Trump?s poll numbers have been cratering for a month now, pointing to what may be a catastrophic loss for the Republicans. Much of that happened because of revelations about Trump?s horrifying misogyny and his ongoing inability to behave with any discipline. But it?s a mistake to discount the huge effect of the debates, well beyond Trump?s predictably ridiculous performance. These were the first occasions since the Benghazi hearings for people to see what Clinton is made of, and it reminded them of the characteristics that make her a formidable leader. When she stood there, face-to-face with Trump, it was clear that one of them was a president. And it wasn?t him.".replace('\n', '')
